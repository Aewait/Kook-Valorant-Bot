KOOK(once called kaiheila) is a Chinese voice communication software.

>Because this bot are only used in Chinese platform,so I didn't write a more detailed Readme in English.Sorry for that

This robot is still at an extremely early stage, and many of the functions I want have not yet been realized.Such as `/store`and`/nightmarket`
